## Methodologies:
1.	Data Cleaning.
2.	Exploratory data analysis
3.	Clustering
4.	Improved clustering using RMF analysis
5.	Conclusion and visualization 

## Conclusion:
RFM and K-means clustering technique is a proven marketing model that helps e-commerce and fintech businesses maximize profit margins through better understanding of various customer segment.
After much data manipulation I arrived at this well-defined segment in the various users of our product below.

1.	Core/Loyal - Your Best Customers
Who They Are: Highly engaged customers who have bought the most recent, the most often, and generated the most revenue
2.	Slipping - Once Loyal, Now Gone
Who They Are: Great past customers who haven't bought in a while
3.	Faithful - The customers having common behaviour across these metrics.
Who They Are: Customer who have average metrics across each RFM scores
4.	Lost - The customers with low recency, frequency and monetary value

The above-generated RFM customer segments can be easily used to identify high ROI segments and engage them with personalized offers.
